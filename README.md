## Introduction
Internships are a critical bridge between academic learning and real-world experience, especially during the eighth semester of a student's education. However, managing internships has traditionally been a cumbersome process, often relying on outdated methods that hinder effective communication and oversight.

## The Problem
The current landscape of internship management is riddled with challenges:
- **Inefficient Communication**: Interns often lack timely feedback from mentors, leading to confusion and isolation.
- **Manual Processes**: Reliance on spreadsheets and paper-based reports creates inefficiencies and increases the administrative burden.
- **Lack of Accountability**: Tracking intern progress is cumbersome, resulting in delays in feedback and oversight.

## Existing Systems
Traditional internship management systems are fragmented and disconnected, relying heavily on manual processes. This leads to:
- Delays in feedback and guidance for interns.
- Ineffective tracking of intern activities.
- A lack of a centralized platform for communication among stakeholders.

## Proposed Solution: InternSync
InternSync is a comprehensive web and mobile platform designed to streamline the management and tracking of internship activities. By automating and centralizing the internship management process, InternSync enhances communication and oversight for all parties involved.

### Key Features
- **Centralized Management**: Automates daily report submissions and provides analytics dashboards for performance monitoring.
- **Hierarchical Access**: Role-based access for interns, college mentors, company mentors, and administrators ensures efficient management.
- **Key Modules**:
  - **Attendance Management**
  - **Daily Report Submission**
  - **Internship Management**
  - **Mentor Assignment**
- **Mobile Application**: Offers seamless access to all functionalities for students and mentors.

## Technical Overview
InternSync leverages modern web technologies to provide a robust solution:
- **Frontend**: Built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript** for a dynamic user experience.
- **Backend**: Utilizes **Supabase** for real-time capabilities and PostgreSQL for data management.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on **Vercel**, ensuring fast and reliable performance.

### Software Requirements
| Technology | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Next.js    | React framework for building web applications |
| TypeScript | Typed JavaScript for better tooling |
| Supabase   | Backend as a Service for real-time capabilities |
| PostgreSQL | Relational database for data management |

### Hardware Requirements
| Provider       | CPU                | Memory (RAM) | Storage                   | Bandwidth     |
|----------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Vercel         | Virtual CPUs (auto-scaled) | Up to 4GB    | Ephemeral storage for serverless functions | 100 GB/month  |
| Supabase       | Virtual CPUs (auto-scaled) | Dynamic memory allocation | 500 MB database storage | 2 GB/month    |

## Conclusion
InternSync is set to revolutionize the internship management process by creating a structured, transparent, and organized experience for all stakeholders. By addressing the inefficiencies of traditional systems, InternSync empowers students, mentors, and administrators to focus on fostering meaningful internship experiences.
